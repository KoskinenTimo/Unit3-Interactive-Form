'Expiration Date:', 'Expiration Year:' fields show a custom message under the inputs if the month/year is not valid(card is not valid in the following month from the time form is submitted). 
'Card Number: *', 'Zip Code: *' and 'CVV: *' show a different message if they type any other characters than digits.
